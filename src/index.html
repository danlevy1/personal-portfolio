                    My programming journey began in 2010 (age 12), when I opened
                    the first page of “Hello World! Computer Programming for
                    Kids and Other Beginners,” written by Carter Sande and
                    Warren Sande. I set there, next to a local tech guru and
                    programmer, contemplating what programming was and why it
                    was important. After a couple of lessons in Python and a
                    seeming lack of interest on my part, I called it quits.
                    Little did I know, programming would become my passion.

                <p class="info-paragraph">
                    I wrote my first Objective-C iOS app in October 2013 using a
                    Udemy course as my guide. Writing Objective-C seemed
                    difficult at the time, and it wasn’t until October of the
                    following year that I fell in love with programming via the
                    Swift language. Every day after school I would work on this
                    Udemy course. This led me to release my first app, a tip
                    calculator, on the iOS app store in December 2015.
                </p>
                <p class="info-paragraph">
                    My love for programming led me to the Florida Institute of
                    Technology, where I graduated Magma Cum Laude with a degree
                    in Computer Science. The small class sizes and personable
                    professors allowed me to excel in the field of programming.
                    I was a member of the ACM and the FIT Programming Club.
                    During my summer break going into senior year, I completed
                    the Treehouse Front-End Web Development Techdegree, which
                    led me to transition from iOS development to web
                    development.

                    I believe that the key to creating a great product is
                    bridging the gap between technology and humans. By following
                    this philosophy, I hope to transform the way people use
                    technology. I intend on supplementing my technical degree
                    with an MBA in a few years in order to come full circle in
                    pursuing my passions of technology and management.
